Algorithm:
When the button on the circuit was pressed shortly, LED on the same circuit must enter twice on-off for 1 second, 
twice on-off for 2 seconds loop(on1-off1-on1-off1-on2-off2-on2-off2-on1-off1-...).
When long press on the button, LED on the same circuit must enter four times on-off for 1 second, four times on-off for 
2 seconds loop.

Rules:
- Debounce time is 100ms. Long press is for 3 seconds.
- Application starts in the short press mode.
- Pressing the button will not affect on-off loop of LED.
- While the button was pressing, LED must continue in the cycle of the current mode. 
When the button released, if changing mode is required, the cycle restarts in new mode.
If changing mode isn't required, the LED cycle will continue as long as the button has never been pressed.
- You can use this software counter module for storing the time values.

Module explanations: 
- There are one button and LED.
- The LED was connected to the GPIO.
- Button was connected to the external GPIO interrupt for capturing press. / LoopCapturing
- One timer peripheral must configure in interrupt mode for 1ms.
